Ivar is a â€˜Value Investingâ€™ bot. He scrapes balance sheets & financial reports from The Wall Street Journal (https://www.wsj.com/market-data) on every ASX 200 Listed company; a list digested regularly from the latest data available at ASX200List (https://www.asx200list.com). He then maintains daily price updates via the ASX ticker API (https://www.asx.com.au).

Based on the Intrinsic Value formula by Benjamin Graham, Ivar calculates daily, searching for undervalued stocks.
